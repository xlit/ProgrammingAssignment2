## The following two functions "makeCacheMatrix" and "cacheSolve" are used to
## create a special object that stores a square invertible matrix and cache's
## its inverse matrix. 

## The first function "makeCacheMatrix" creats, for a given square invertible 
## matrix, a special "matrix" object which is really a list of functions to
## 1) set the value of the matrix
## 2) get the value of the matrix
## 3) set the value of the inverse matrix
## 4) get the value of the inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    ## 'x' is a square invertible matrix 
    
    inv <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        inv <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setsolve <- function(solve) inv <<- solve
    getsolve <- function() inv
    list(set = set, get = get,
         setsolve = setsolve,
         getsolve = getsolve)
}

## The second function "casheSolve" computes the inverse of the special "matrix" 
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated
## (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the 
## inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of the original matrix 'x'
    inv <- x$getsolve()
    if(!is.null(inv)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(inv)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    inv <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setsolve(inv)
    inv
}
